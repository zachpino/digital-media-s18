###Next Steps
---

Much was accomplished [this week](readme.md). Our grid system was built, tested, and improved with responsive styles. And, we've brought visual elements into our designs through imagery and css properties.

Next week, Javascript instruction will begin, allowing the design of dynamic content and interactive elements. In preparation for that, we need a few things in place â€” we need to build out our web container with some placeholders!

- Project Title
- Subtitle
- Hero Image
- Video
- Gallery of Storyboard Images (12 Frames)
- App Screens
- Terrain and Territory Map
- Explanatory Text
- Anything Else!

All elements should nest inside of the divs you built for your responsive grid.
