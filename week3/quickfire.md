### Quickfire Exercise

Please create 3 web pages highlighting content from 3 former projects. Begin by sketching the layout on paper, and attempt to build it with as few elements as possible. If you don't have your own works to slot in, feel free to replace with information on [cute animals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baikal_seal). No lorem ipsum! 

Make sure the [typography](https://cssreference.io/typography/) is considered.
