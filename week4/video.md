###Showing Video Content

---

Showing videos on a website is very similar to showing images. We use a special tag, set some attributes, and make sure the file is in the right place on our server!

```
<video autoplay controls muted class="hero-vid" width="100%" src="assets/aquarium.mp4">
```

This video, sourced form the amazing [Mazwai](http://mazwai.com) -- a sort [Unsplash](http://www.unsplash.com) for video -- is in the mp4 format which is fairly cross-compatible across modern browsers.

The `<video>` tag takes a `src` attribute, pointing it to an individual video file. It can be assigned width and/or height to specify non-native playback size (here set to 100% of its parent, a `row` div).

Most importantly, though, are some useful attributes that don't take values. Namely, `autoplay`, `muted`, `controls` which respectively determine whether or not the video starts playing on page load, has sound, and show playback controls. Try your video with and without those attributes!

We can now bring in [SVG content](svg.md) from Illustrator to complete the content on our page!
