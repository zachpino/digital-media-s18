### Homework for 2/19/18

---

Use the code from this week to create a simple webpage with several buttons (defined below) that cause a single or many empty `<div>`s to exhibit the following select emotions/reactions/behaviors. Explore all the CSS properties you can animate -- not only marginal position but also `background-color`, `width`, `height`, `border-radius`, `opacity`, `border-color`, `border-width`, and [many more](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/default.asp). 

Note that, to animate any changes to the `border` of an element, that element *must already have a border*, for instance, by setting it to have `border-width: 0px; border-color: #000` in the `style` tag of your page. This will ensure the object starts with an invisible black border, which will be the state from which the animation begins.

Each animation should have its own labeled button (these can all be on one HTML page, though you can also spread them out if you like to keep the code neater), and each animation should be meaningfully unique. Watch yourself showing these emotions in the mirror to gain some ideas if you're stuck, or explore how mobile apps try to communicate similar personality in their UI elements.
