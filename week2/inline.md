###Week 2: Inline Elements

-----

In addition to [block-level elements](block.md), which take up 100% of the horizontal space on the page, there also exists elements which can sit next to one another. These are called *inline elements*. We have already used one: the anchor `<a>` tag.

#####`<em>` Emphasis Element

```
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  
  <body>
    <p>
      This is <em>emphatic text</em>.
    </p>
  </body>
</html>  
```

<hr />
This is <em>emphatic text</em>.
<hr />


#####`<strong>` Strong Element

```
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  
  <body>
    <p>
      This is <strong>emphatic text</strong>.
    </p>
  </body>
</html>  
```

<hr />
This is <strong>strong text</strong>.
<hr />


#####`<s>` Strike-Through Element

```
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  
  <body>
    <p>
      This is <s>stricken text</s>.
    </p>
  </body>
</html>  
```

<hr />
This is <s>stricken text</s>.

These styles can all be replicated and improved with [CSS styling](inline-css.md).
