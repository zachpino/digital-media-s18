###JQuery

---

Our page looks good! We have [diagrams](svg.md) and [videos](video.md) on the page. 

[JQuery](http://jquery.com) is a javascript library -- a set of functions that we can use that makes using a complex and inconsistent language like Javascript easier. It is implemented by a huge percentage of the internet, at least [71% as of February, 2017](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/js-jquery/all/all). It is designed specifically to help create interactive and animated web experiences.

Let's bring JQuery into our website. At the head of your page, include the following

```
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js"></script>
```

You don't need JQuery, it just makes lots of things simpler and more convenient. There are also alternative Javascript libraries worth exploring that have different focuses.

- [D3](http://d3js.org) for Data Visualization]
- [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org) and [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) for Web Apps
- [Paper.js](http://paperjs.org) and [Raphael](http://dmitrybaranovskiy.github.io/raphael/) for Diagramming
- [MooTools](https://mootools.net) for Complex Interactions

Now, let's deploy JQuery to find out what a user [clicks](clicks.md) on!
