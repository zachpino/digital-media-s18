###Week 1: HTML

-----

[HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML), an acronym for *hypertext markup language*, is a lightweight formatting language for defining the structure of interactive web content. Everything that ever appears on a website is in some way manifested in HTML â€” though importantly that HTML code may have been generated with another procedural language, such as Javascript. Invented in 1991 by Tim Berners Lee, it is by all accounts the most prolific *scripting* (non-*functional*, used for layout and automation) programming language in history. 

The HTML scripting language uses `tags` to distinguish computer-readable page structure and functionality from human-readable content and styling. Tags are always surrounded by `<` and `>` characters, and are closed off with a near duplicate of themselves. Tags often include `attributes`, which shape their functionality and behavior.

`<tag attribute1="value" attribute2="value">Optional Visible Information</tag>`

Tags can be nested as well, which are indented by convention and described in familiar metaphor.

```html
<parent-tag>
  parent content
  <child-tag>
    child content
  </child-tag>
</parent-tag>
```

Let's create our first HTML page and learn about [HTML block elements](block.md).
